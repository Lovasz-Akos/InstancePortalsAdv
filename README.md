# Instance Portals Advanced
This AddOn displays Dungeon & Raid Instance Portals on the Continent Map.
This is an Advanced Version of "Instance Portals" by StevenTroughtonSmith but with more Features and way more Accurate Dungeon & Raid Entrance Pins!

It also got the Feature to a Waypoint by ***SHIFT + LeftClick*** an Instance Portal Pin on the Contnent Map as well as for the Zone Map.
The Waypoint Feature supports TomTom and will Fallback to the Original Blizzard Waypoint System if TomTom is not installed.
You can also "force" to use the Original Blizzard Waypoint System by ***CTRL + SHIFT + LeftClick*** an Instance Portal Pin if you need it.
